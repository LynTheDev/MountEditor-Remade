# MountEditor-Remade
Mount Editor but remade with a new library! Mount Editor is a text editor made with WinForms in pure C#, it has highlights for C,C++ and C#. Mount Editor is a very simple program made by one person with handmade assets, happy coding!
- this project wasn't made with serious intent in mind, this is the second time I use WinForms and the program will break .

- library used FCTB
- assets made with aseprite
